## What is Draft AI?

Draft AI is a full-stack AI platform built for mechanical engineers. Upload any engineering drawing — or open any sketch in SolidWorks — and get an instant, intelligent analysis.

No more manual checking. No more missed dimensions. No more drawings bouncing back from manufacturers.

```
Engineering Drawing / SolidWorks Sketch
              ↓
         Draft AI
              ↓
  ┌───────────────────────────┐
  │  Dimensions detected      │
  │  GD&T reviewed            │
  │  Standards checked        │
  │  Cost estimated           │
  │  Manufacturability scored │
  │  Missing dims flagged     │
  │  BOM extracted            │

              ↓
    Actionable report. Instantly.
```

## Platform Overview

Draft AI has two main parts:

### 🌐 Web Application
A Streamlit-powered app where engineers upload drawings and get full AI analysis — accessible from any browser, no installation needed.

### ⚙️ SolidWorks Add-in
A native Windows add-in that lives inside SolidWorks — press `Ctrl+Shift+A` in any sketch and get instant feedback without leaving your CAD environment.

## Features

### Web App — Drawing Analysis

| # | Feature | Description |
|---|---------|-------------|
| 01 | 📐 **Dimension Detection** | Extracts all dimensions, tolerances, and units from any drawing automatically |
| 02 | 🎯 **GD&T Analysis** | Full geometric dimensioning and tolerancing review per ASME Y14.5 |
| 03 | ✅ **Standards Checker** | Scored compliance report across 8 categories — ASME Y14.5, ISO GPS, BS 8888 |
| 04 | 📋 **BOM Generator** | Extracts Bill of Materials from assembly drawings — export to Excel or PDF |
| 05 | 💰 **Cost Estimation** | AI-powered cost estimate based on material, complexity, and manufacturing method |
| 06 | 🏭 **Manufacturability Score** | 0–100 DFM score — catches machining problems before you send to production |
| 07 | ⚠️ **Design Concerns** | CRITICAL / WARNING / INFO severity flags on real design issues |
| 08 | 🔄 **Revision Comparison** | Upload two revisions — get a diff of exactly what changed between Rev A and Rev B |
| 09 | 📦 **Batch Analysis** | Analyze up to 5 drawings at once — single Excel or PDF export |
| 10 | 🏷️ **Title Block Extraction** | Reads and structures all title block metadata automatically |
| 11 | 📊 **Tolerance Stack-Up** | Calculates cumulative tolerances across a dimension chain |
| 12 | 🔍 **Missing Dimension Detection** | Flags under-dimensioned features before release |

### SolidWorks Add-in — Live Sketch Analysis

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| ⚡ **Ctrl+Shift+A Hotkey** | Global hotkey — works even when SolidWorks has focus |
| 🔍 **Sketch Analyzer** | Reads segment data from SW API — tells you exactly what's underdefined |
| ✅ **Fully Defined Detection** | Instantly detects when your sketch is fully defined — no false alerts |
| 🔔 **Toast Notifications** | Hover-to-pause, scrollable, auto-dismiss overlay in SolidWorks |
| 🌐 **HTTP API** | Local server on port 7432 — integrates with any external tool |

### 3D → 2D Converter

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 📁 **STEP / STP Support** | Upload any STEP file — Draft AI opens it in SolidWorks automatically |
| 📷 **4 View Export** | Front, Top, Side, and Isometric views exported as PNG |
| 📏 **Dimension Extraction** | Exact bounding box dimensions extracted from the 3D model |
| 📄 **A3 Drawing Sheet** | Professional PDF with title block, drawing number, revision, and all 4 views |

## Why Draft AI?

Most engineering AI tools are either too generic or locked behind expensive enterprise software. Draft AI is built specifically for the engineer sitting at the desk — the student getting underdefined sketches, the freelancer whose drawings get bounced back, the small team that can't afford a Dassault 3DEXPERIENCE license.

> *"I built this because I was tired of doing the same repetitive checks every time I needed a drawing."*
